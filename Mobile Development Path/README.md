Our goal as the Mobile Development team is to develop a user-friendly, effective plant disease detection app, here's the detail:

## 1. Tools
- **Development Environment**: Android Studio
- **Language**: Kotlin and XML

## 2. Key Features
- Upload a plant leaf image for disease detection.
- Display disease classification, impact, symptoms, tips & tricks, and treatment recommendations.
- Save history in the app's local database using Room for offline access and data persistence.

## 3. Architecture
This app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to separate concerns:

- **Model**: Manages the data and business logic of the application, such as handling API requests, processing data, and interacting with the database.
- **View**: Represents the UI elements, which users interact with. It is responsible for rendering the information provided by the ViewModel.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a mediator between the Model and the View, handling presentation logic, and preparing data to be displayed in the UI.

## 4. Future Features
- **Authentication and Login** functionality to provide a personalized experience for users.
- **Push notifications** for disease management tips and reminders.

## 5. UI/UX
- The app's UI has been designed and prototyped using **Figma** to ensure a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly experience.
- Focus on providing a seamless and visually appealing user interface.

In the process, we both worked together in building this app, from the initial design, to the development.
