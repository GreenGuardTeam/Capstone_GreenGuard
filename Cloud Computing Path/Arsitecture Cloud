4. **Backend Service (Node.js)**  
   This backend will handle requests from applications and carry out processes to call Machine Learning (ML) models and access data from the database.

5. **Machine Learning Models (ML)**  
   The ML model will receive image input from the backend, process it, and output plant disease diagnosis results.

6. **Databases (Cloud SQL)**  
   This database stores plant disease reference data, additional information, and treatment solutions.

7. **Cloud Storage (Image Storage)**  
   Cloud Storage functions to store plant images uploaded by users via the application.

8. **Output Results and Response to Users**  
   Mobile application that shows responses in the form of diagnoses and solutions.

9. **Monitoring and Logging**  
   Cloud Monitoring to log activity and assist in performance monitoring.
