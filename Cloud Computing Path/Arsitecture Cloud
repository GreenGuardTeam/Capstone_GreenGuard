System Architecture Overview
The diagram depicts the flow of data and processes within the system, which consists of the following components:

User Interaction via Mobile Application:

The user interacts with the mobile application to provide input or make a request. The mobile app serves as the front-end interface.
API Gateway:

The mobile application communicates with the backend server through an API gateway. This gateway routes the requests to the appropriate backend services.
Backend Node with Flask Framework:

The backend is built using the Flask framework, which processes the requests from the mobile application. It acts as the intermediary between the user, the ML model, and other services.
Machine Learning Model:

The ML model hosted within the backend processes the data and generates the output or prediction based on the user's input.
Cloud Storage Bucket:

Static resources or large datasets required by the ML model are stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. The backend accesses these resources when needed.
Deployment via Cloud Run:

The Flask backend and ML model are deployed on Google Cloud Run, a serverless platform, enabling scalable and efficient management of backend services.
Response Delivery:

After processing the data, the system sends the output or result back to the mobile application, where it is displayed to the user.
Key Features:
Scalable Deployment: The use of Cloud Run ensures that the backend services scale automatically based on demand.
Seamless Integration: The system integrates a mobile application with backend services and ML processing, providing a user-friendly experience.
Cost Efficiency: With a serverless architecture, resources are allocated only when required, reducing operational costs.
This architecture is ideal for applications requiring real-time processing, such as personalized recommendations, data analysis, or image recognition tasks.
