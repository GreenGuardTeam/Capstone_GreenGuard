1. Start with Users

2. Mobile Application
This mobile application will scan plant images.

3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - API Gateway
API Gateway functions as a bridge that manages access to APIs and directs requests to backend services.

4. Backend Service (Node.js)
This backend will handle requests from applications and carry out processes to call Machine Learning (ML) models and access data from the database.

Machine Learning Models (ML)
The ML model will receive image input from the backend, process it, and output plant disease diagnosis results.

5. Databases (Cloud SQL)
This database stores plant disease reference data, additional information, and treatment solutions.

6. Cloud Storage (Image Storage)
Cloud Storage functions to store plant images uploaded by users via the application.

7. Output Results and Response to Users
Mobile application that shows responses in the form of diagnoses and solutions.

8. Monitoring and Logging
Cloud Monitoring to log activity and assist in performance monitoring.
