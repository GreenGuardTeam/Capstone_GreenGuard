The Machine Learning component of GreenGuard aims to accurately detect plant diseases using image recognition. We have completed several key stages in developing this model:

### 1. Data Inspection 🔍
   - Before starting model development, we conducted thorough data inspection. This process involved checking the quality, consistency, and distribution of the data to ensure the dataset was ready for machine learning applications.

### 2. Data Cleaning 🧹
   - We cleaned the data to remove anomalies, noise, and low-quality images. This step is essential for improving data quality, allowing the model to learn from relevant and valid information, which enhances the accuracy of disease detection.

### 3. Data Augmentation 🌱
   - To increase the data volume and make the model more robust to image variations, we applied data augmentation. Techniques like rotation, flipping, cropping, and lighting adjustments were used, helping the model generalize better and recognize diseases under different conditions.

### 4. Model Development ⚙️
   - We are currently developing and refining the machine learning model to achieve high accuracy in plant disease detection. Various algorithms and optimization techniques are being tested to improve the model’s performance.
